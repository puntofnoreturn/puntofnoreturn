### Welcome!

Hey everyone, thanks for coming here to read the blog. If you're not familiar with who I am or what I'm doing, you can check out a brief overview on the [about](../about) page.

The impetus for starting this blog was - as most people in the world can relate to in April/May of 2020 - being stuck in a small apartment for weeks on end.  In an effort to stay sane, I've been messing around with a lot of football statistics.  Some of what I'm finding is interesting enough that I think its worth a share, especially since most sports statistics skew towards very rudimentary analysis.

Anyways, not everything I look into will end up being particularly interesting, especially because football is a sport with a lot of variables and intricacies. To name a few issues off the top of my head:
- Low sample size data sets - Analyzing draft classes, for instance
- High variance data - Fumbles dramatically change expected point values and fumble recoveries *can* be random
- Time drift - Football changes season-to-season due to offensive efficiency, rule changes, etc
- Individual player attribution - One of the more interesting things to me is trying to attribute point values to each player, but there are a lot of challenges in that. Even for a position like punter, expected points can be attributed to punting, punt coverage, and even the coach's decision to punt in the first place

Needless to say, I find this all fascinating and look forward to blogging about all of my dumb ideas.  I will probably create a few projects in the long term that track teams or players historically, but until then I'll just be doing some blog posts.  Just keep in mind that this blog is going to be an infrequently updated site, so if you do end up stumbling across something interesting, please don't expect a new white paper every week...

Happy reading

-Greg
