        Hey, you're probaby here because I wrote something semi-controversial or marginally interesting that you saw elsewhere on the internet.  If you've somehow stumbled on this site for other reasons, I have no advice for how you should proceed.

        Anyways, welcome to my little football analytics blog! I'm Greg. Just some random guy living in NYC with a little bit of time and a heavy interest in football.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sadly, that interest in football comes at a price... I'm a Jets fan.  In an effort to still have fun with football, I've looked at a lot of analytics around the sport and thought it might make sense to share my own views.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the most part, the data I'm using will come from some combination of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href='https://www.pro-football-reference.com/'>Pro Football Reference</a></li>
        <li>NFL.com, via <a href='https://github.com/ryurko/nflscrapR-data'>nflscrapR</a></li>
        <li><a href='https://overthecap.com/'>Over the Cap</a></li>
        <li>Other randomly assorted datasets</a></li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        Keep in mind that all of this analysis is from my armchair - I'm not employed in any way in the sports analytics community.  My job outside of this hobby does involve quite a bit of data analysis, but it would be wise to take everything I say with a few grains of salt...
      </p>

        And with all that said, happy browsing! If you have any comments, feel free to drop me a line on Twitter (I don't use Twitter personally, so your message will be sure to actually get to me).
